# Hipo - Android Summer Internship

- I fetch the JSON file that Hipo gave by using Retrofit in the StartActivity and I use RecyclerView to list all members. 
- After tapping one of the members, her/his details are shown with custom dialog.
- Users can sort members by their names, ages or locations with ascending or descending order.
- The app also gives search suggestions.

These details can be seen in the screenshots below.
